# Quick-Image-Separations

A module for Python 3.6 designed to quickly estimate image separations of lensed sources by extracting a 5-sigma mask of an input image and determining a best-fit circle using [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/odr.html](Orthogonal Distance Regression).

This has been developed for application to continuum images of lensed sources pulled from the [https://almascience.nrao.edu/aq/](ALMA Science Archive).
